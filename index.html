        <p>I like being Creative because I feel like I can express myself through art. Whether it's crocheting, drawing, painting, knitting, making random items with resin, etc. I am 11 years old and whenever I have free time I like to spend it doing one of the things thatI have listed. I am really getting into making things like jewlery with resin and other things. So far I have made necklaces and a pair of earrings, and I am planning to to make barretes and a kooty key.
